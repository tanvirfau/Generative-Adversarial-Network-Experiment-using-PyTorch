# Generative Adversarial Network Experiment using PyTorch

This project is a fork of [PyTorch-GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN) by Erik Lindernoren.  
The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN).

## About

I forked the [PyTorch-GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN) repository to explore different GAN implementations and test the models on new datasets. 

### Modifications include:
- Added new evaluation metrics for model performance analysis.
- Implemented additional GAN models like **DCGAN**, **WGAN**, and others.
- Improved code readability and optimization for better efficiency.
- Enhanced dataset support for training and testing.
- Added examples for using different architectures on diverse datasets.

## Features
- A variety of GAN models such as **DCGAN**, **WGAN**, **CycleGAN**, **Pix2Pix**, etc.
- Easy-to-use scripts for training models on different datasets.
- Well-documented codebase with additional features for better evaluation of GANs.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies see below:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tanvirfau/Generative-Adversarial-Network-Experiment-using-PyTorch
$ cd Generative-Adversarial-Network-Experiment-using-PyTorch
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
